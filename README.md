Challenge 11, take and save notes


This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

In this application the user will be able to enter notes, save notes and clear notes. Once notes are entered they will be on left hand column.  Then the user will be able to clear the notes. 

I used alot of code from activites from this module and a starter code from the assignment with a help of tudors.  

What makes this project stand out is that you are able to enter notes and save them and have a lists conveniently right there where you can see them.
